# Introduction to R Markdown

In this repo, you will find all you need to reproduce the slides of [an introduction to R Markdown](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/intro_rmarkdown/). 
Clone or download the repo, then just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley:

You may train yourself at writing reproducible documents with R Markdown by doing a practical: questions [here](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/intro_rmarkdown_practical/) and code [there](https://github.com/oliviergimenez/intro_rmarkdown_practical) with solutions.

I released the first version of the slides on Oct 24, 2020.
