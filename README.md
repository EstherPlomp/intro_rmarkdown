# Introduction to R Markdown

In this repo, you will find all you need to reproduce the slides of [an introduction to R Markdown](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/intro_rmarkdown/). 
Clone or download the repo, then just open the Rmd file and Knit it :smiley:

I released the first version of the slides on Oct 24, 2020.
